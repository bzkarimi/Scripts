Workfunction
============

A Fortran program to calculate a 1D planar averaged electrostatic potential from a 3D potential grid for the density functional theory code VASP. It can be used to compute the workfunction (or ionisation potential) for a material surface or as an alignment technique for comparing the electronic eigenvalues of different systems. 

We recommend [MacroDensity](https://github.com/WMD-Group/MacroDensity), which more flexible and powerful.
